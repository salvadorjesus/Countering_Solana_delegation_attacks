Some Solana scam attacks include a delegation of the victim’s token accounts to steal from her in future transactions.

I propose closing the user’s token accounts with an Open Source Dapp ([Solana Free Redeemer](https://github.com/loopcreativeandy/fee-redeemer)) as an user-friendly way to defend against the attack.

In this [document](https://github.com/salvadorjesus/Countering_Solana_delegation_attacks/blob/446264e5b4d5495ce9e948bba3ae8c89b077a16b/Closing%20Solana%20token%20accounts%20with%20an%20open%20source%20DApp%20to%20defend%20against%20scams.pdf) I demonstrate how easy it is for the user and how this effectively counters the delegation attack.
