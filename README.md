Some Solana scam attacks include a delegation of the victim’s token accounts to steal from her in future transactions.

I propose closing the user’s token accounts with an Open Source Dapp ([Solana Free Redeemer](https://github.com/loopcreativeandy/fee-redeemer)) as an user-friendly way to defend against the attack.

In this document I demonstrate how easy it is for the user and how this effectively counters the delegation attack.
